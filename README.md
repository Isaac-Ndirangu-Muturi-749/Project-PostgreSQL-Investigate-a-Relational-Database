# Project-PostgreSQL-Investigate-a-Relational-Database
A comprehensive SQL project investigating a rental movie database from Sakilla using PostgreSQL
![movierental](images/movierental.png)

This project involves querying and analyzing a relational database containing rental movies data from the "Sakila" database. The goal is to gain insights into the movie rental patterns and customer behavior using SQL queries and data visualization. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to run the SQL queries.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the rental movies database using SQL queries. The database contains various tables such as `film`, `category`, `rental`, `payment`, and more. The queries aim to answer specific questions related to rental orders, customer behavior, and movie categories.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the "Sakila" database, which simulates a DVD rental store. The database includes information about movies, customers, rentals, payments, and more. The data is used to extract insights and answer questions about movie rentals and customer preferences.

You can find the data in the dvdrental.tar file in the data folder.

## SQL Queries

The project consists of several SQL queries that address different questions about the rental movies database. These queries involve joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions to extract meaningful insights from the data.

The queries cover the following topics:
- Comparison of rental order counts between two stores
- Top 10 paying customers and their payment amounts per month in 2007
- Monthly payment differences for top 10 paying customers in 2007
- Analysis of family-friendly movie categories and their rental durations

The SQL code is in the set 1 questions and set 2 questions folders

## Results

The results of each SQL query provide insights into the rental movie data. These results include information such as rental order counts, payment amounts, payment differences, and rental duration averages. The findings offer valuable insights into customer behavior, movie preferences, and trends.

The results are saved in csv.files

## Data Visualization

In addition to the SQL queries, the project suggests visualizing the results using tools like Microsoft Excel. The visualizations can help convey the insights more effectively, making it easier to understand trends and patterns in the data.

The visualization can be found in the excel files

## How to Run

To run the SQL queries and obtain the results, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the "Sakila" database available in your preferred SQL server.
2. Open your SQL editor or tool (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio).
3. Copy and paste the SQL queries from the project into your SQL editor.
4. Execute the queries one by one to obtain the results.

Note: Some queries may require slight modifications based on your SQL server's syntax and configuration.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need access to a SQL server with the "Sakila" database loaded. Additionally, you may choose to visualize the results using Microsoft Excel or other data visualization tools.
